She loved chasing ribbons and leaping for toys, but between games, she would quietly perch by the window, as if contemplating the world. Wise yet spirited, Sage was waiting for a special home where her playful heart and thoughtful gaze could bring warmth and joy to a family ready to embrace her unique charm.",
